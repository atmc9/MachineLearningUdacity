Submitting the Project
Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the Machine Learning Capstone project rubric. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be meeting specifications for you to pass.

Submission Files
At minimum, your submission will be required to have the following files listed below. If your submission method of choice is uploading an archive (*.zip), please take into consideration the total file size. You will need to include

Your capstone proposal document as proposal.pdf if you have completed the pre-requisite Capstone Proposal project. Please also include your review link in the student submission notes.
A project report (in PDF format only) addressing the five major project development stages. The recommended page length for a project report is approximately nine to fifteen pages. Please do not export an iPython Notebook as PDF for your project report.
All development Python code used for your project that is required to reproduce your implemented solution and result. Your code should be in a neat and well-documented format. Using iPython Notebooks is strongly encouraged for development.
A README documentation file which briefly describes the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary references to supporting material. If your project requires setup/startup, ensure that your README includes the necessary instructions.
Any additional supporting material such as datasets, images, or input files that are necessary for your project's development and implementation. If these files are too large and you are uploading your submission, instead provide appropriate means of acquiring the necessary files in your included README.
Once you have collected these files and reviewed the project rubric, proceed to the project submission page.
