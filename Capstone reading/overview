Capstone Project Overview
In this capstone project, you will leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct conclusions about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.

Capstone Project Highlights
This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

How to research and investigate a real-world problem of interest.
How to accurately apply specific machine learning algorithms and techniques.
How to properly analyze and visualize your data and results for validity.
How to document and write a report of your work.
