Report Guidelines
Your project submission will be evaluated primarily on the report that is submitted. It is expected that the project report contains enough detail, documentation, analysis, and discussion to adequately reflect the work you completed for your project. Because of this, it is extremely important that the report is written in a professional, standardized way, so those who review your project submission are able to clearly identify each component of your project in the report. Without a properly written report, your project cannot be sufficiently evaluated. A project report template is provided for you to understand how a project report should be structured. We strongly encourage students to have a report that is approximately nine to fifteen pages in length.

The Machine Learning Capstone Project report should be treated no different than a written research paper for academics. Your goal is to ultimately present the research you've discovered into the respective problem domain you've chosen, and then discuss each stage of the project as they are completed. The narrative found in the project report template provides for a "report checklist" that will aid you in staying on track for both your project and the documentation in your report. Each stage can be found as a section that will guide you through each component of the project development life cycle. Please make use of this resource!
