Machine Learning: Teaching computers to perform tasks from past experience(data).
       Voice recognition, spam detection, fraud detection, stock market, self driving cars.

Navie Bayes: Based on the probability of  success in the existing data, we can predict the new data.

Gradient Descent: What is the better way to move our prediction line to reduce the error.
      Linear regression - best line through the points
      Logistic regression - minimize the sum of Error function for wrongly classified data
      Super vector Machines - place the line that increases the minimum distance of points to the line.

Neural Network: It is dividing the data into regions. Network of the decision chain.
Kernel Method: dividing with a plane or coming up with a curve

K-Mean clustering: Place the ClusterCenters randomly and find the distance to their closest points, move the Centers to have the less distance
and follow the step to include the new points that are close to other centers and repeat it.

Hierarchal Clustering: Here the distance of how far we  can go to include in a cluster, determines the number of clusters.
